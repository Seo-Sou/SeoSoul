                        <P>LAST STORY:</P> 
                        <strong>The skins we live</strong> 
    In the world of the Bamberg mansion, where magic and ancient legacies reign, an extraordinary tale unfolds. Arthur, born without the coveted magical mark, becomes the center of a family's concern and intrigue.
    
    As he grows up in the secluded shadows of the Church of the Three Lights, Arthur's silent presence conceals a dormant power within himâ€”the magic of shadows.
    
    His destiny takes an unexpected turn when the enigmatic Shadow Dancers, an order of assassins, recognize his unique potential.
